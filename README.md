A low order thermal model for single floored houses
This repository pertains to my Masters thesis work. I used Energy+ and Openstudio to simulate a small house in different cities across the US. The simulation data was then used to benchmark a proposed low order model. The low order model predicted the energy consumption by the house by simulating the HVAC system's turning on and off events. I used Matlab to for statistical analysis of the benchmarking data and model fitting on for the house thermal properties and those of the HVAC system.
